# Docker_Basic
Understanding Docker with Ubuntu as a base.

Made Docker file with Ubuntu as base 
Helped understand that file exexution occur in order.
If change is encountered in any line of Dockerfile from that point again execution will take place 
Order must be such that file vulnerable to change is kept at distance from beginning
